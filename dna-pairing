// The point was made in the solutions that a switch case might be more elegant and less wordy. 
// I agree, but this was the first way I did it. I usually only pull out the switch case when
// I have five or more cases. The most elegant by far was creating an object with properties named
// for each base. Then the string is split and it's corresponding array mapped over using the object 
// to fill in the missing pair. Very elegant. Wish I'd have thought of it. :p
